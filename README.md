# Social Backend API

Welcome to the **Social Backend API**, a fully-featured backend service designed for social networking platforms. This API, built using the Chi router in Go, integrates robust user authentication, efficient post and comment management, and seamless integration with PostgreSQL.

The backend uses JWT for secure session management and leverages GORM for database migrations, ensuring data consistency and ease of development. With modular routing and well-structured services, the API provides a scalable foundation for building social applications.
